### Smart contract lottery

1.Users can enter the lottery with ETH based on a USD fee(E.g entry price is 50 usd and the user is paying with ethereum)
2.An admin will choose when the lottery is over(Possible options: Have the lottery end after a specific amount of time. Or have a DAO choose when to end the lottery)
3.The lottery will select a random winner

2.`development`:
